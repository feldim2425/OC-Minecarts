## Network Rail Controller

![A Block](block:ocminecart:networkrailbase@5)

Works on all sides like a normal [network cable](/%LANGUAGE%/block/cable.md), but not on the top side.
On the top side no cables can connect, but [Networkrails](netrail.md) can.

In the GUI you can set the connection type and a camouflage block for the top side.

##### Connection Types:
- Network:             Act like a switch.
- Power:               Charge cart.
- Network + Power:  Do both.
- None:                Do nothing.

The connectiontype only effects the connection to the networkrail.

You can only put normal rendered, opaque blocks in the camoslot.
