# Computer Cart
![I like trains!](item:ocminecart:itemcomputercart@0)
You create a computer cart by placing a [computer cart case](cartcase.md). in an [assembler](/%LANGUAGE%/block/assembler.md).

Like normal minecarts, computer carts can only be placed on rails.
They can also be placed by a dispenser.

Computer carts cannot connect to external components and they can't break or place blocks.
But they can send messages via cable if the cart stands on a [networkrail](../block/netrail.md)


If you break the cart, it drops the inventory of the cart and a computer cart will keep its internal components.

#### Emblems
You can attach railcraft emblems to the computercart. Just craft it together with an emblem.
If you already attached an emblem to the cart, you can also change it with the same method, but you won't get back the emblem.
You can remove the emblem by placing the cart in the crafting table with a crowbar.
The crowbar will not get damaged but you will lose the emblem.
